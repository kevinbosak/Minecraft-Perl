This is a collection of perl libraries that can be used to read, write
and manipulate data files from the game Minecraft (see http://minecraft.net).

Currently, the dependencies are as follows:

Perl 5.9 (due to how I'm using pack/unpack)
Compress::Zlib
Mouse
Math::BigInt
Readonly
Data::Dumper

Right now this project is quite incomplete and usage may change as it's
developed more.  However, you can currently read/write NBT files and mess
with map chunks a bit.  I've successfully modified both the level.dat
and chunk files and generated maps from the block and height map data.


TODO:

* Flesh out Minecraft::Map with entities and other related objects.
* Fix chunk class to update height map, skylight, etc. when blocks array
    is updated
* Add routines to check for valid data (block/item types, etc.)
* I also hope to eventually add portions of the client/server protocol

If you have any issues, questions, or contributions, please email Kevin Bosak at
kevin@bosak.net.
